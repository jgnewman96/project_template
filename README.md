# project_template

Template for starting a new project. Everything should be ready to go out of the box!

Just change the name in `CODEOWNERS` and the project name in `.github/workflows/config.yml`.

# Running code

Run `docker-compose up` to spin up both the backend and the frontend. You can then visit both using the ports. The backend should be exposed on `http://localhost:4000/docs` and the frontend should be at `http://localhost:3000`
